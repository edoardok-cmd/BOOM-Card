# Netlify Deployment - Peer Dependency Fix Applied ✅

## Issue
The build was failing due to peer dependency conflicts:
- `react-qr-reader@3.0.0-beta-1` requires React 16 or 17
- `react-swipeable-views` has sub-dependencies requiring React 16
- Project uses React 18

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Immediate Fix (Applied)**
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to npm install in netlify.toml
- Created `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- Set `NODE_ENV=development` to ensure devDependencies are installed

### 2. **Build Command Updated**
```toml
command = "npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build"
```

### 3. **Created .npmrc File**
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
engine-strict=false
```

## Next Steps in Netlify

1. **Retry the deployment** - It should now work with these fixes
2. **Clear cache and deploy** if needed

## Future Improvements (Optional)

To properly fix this long-term, consider:

1. **Update react-qr-reader** to a React 18 compatible version:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall react-qr-reader
   npm install @yudiel/react-qr-scanner
   ```

2. **Replace react-swipeable-views** with a React 18 compatible alternative:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall react-swipeable-views
   npm install swiper
   ```

3. **Or use modern alternatives**:
   - For QR: `react-qr-code` (for generating) or `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner` (for scanning)
   - For swipeable views: `swiper` or `embla-carousel-react`

## Current Status

✅ Build configuration fixed
✅ Peer dependency conflicts resolved (using legacy mode)
✅ Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ Ready for Netlify deployment retry

The deployment should now succeed!
