# Netlify Deployment Fix Applied ✅

## Changes Made

1. **Created root-level `netlify.toml`** with proper configuration:
   - Set `base = "frontend"` to point to the frontend directory
   - Added explicit `npm install` to the build command
   - Set Node version to 18 (LTS)
   - Added Next.js plugin configuration

2. **Removed monorepo structure** that was confusing Netlify:
   - Renamed `package.json` to `package.json.monorepo`
   - This prevents Netlify from detecting npm workspaces

## Current Configuration

```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## Next Steps

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - The build should now work with the updated configuration
   - If you already have a failed deployment, click "Retry deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

2. **Environment Variables to Add in Netlify:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5002/api
   ```
   (Update this to your production API URL when backend is deployed)

3. **If Build Still Fails:**
   - Check the new build logs
   - Common issues:
     - Missing dependencies in package.json
     - TypeScript errors (can disable with `next build || true` temporarily)
     - Memory issues (can add `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`)

## Verification

The deployment should now:
- ✅ Find the frontend directory
- ✅ Install dependencies correctly
- ✅ Build the Next.js application
- ✅ Deploy the `.next` directory

## Alternative: Deploy without GitHub Integration

If you still have issues, you can deploy directly:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
netlify deploy --dir=.next --prod
```

This will create a site first, then you can link it to GitHub later.
