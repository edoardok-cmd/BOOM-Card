# Alternative: Set up Database via Supabase Web Interface

Since the connection is having DNS issues, let's set up the database directly through the Supabase web interface.

## Step 1: Run Schema via SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New query**
4. Copy the entire contents of `database/schema.sql` 
5. Paste it into the query editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the schema

## Step 2: Verify Tables Were Created

1. Go to **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
2. You should see all the tables:
   - users
   - user_profiles
   - subscriptions
   - partners
   - partner_locations
   - discount_offers
   - transactions
   - payment_transactions
   - reviews
   - user_favorites
   - notifications
   - verification_tokens

## Step 3: Try Connection Again Later

Sometimes new Supabase projects take 5-10 minutes to be fully accessible via external connections. You can:

1. Wait 10 minutes and try the connection test again
2. Use the **Transaction pooler** connection string instead (IPv4 compatible)
3. Check if your Supabase project shows as "Active" (not "Setting up")

## Current Status

✅ **Redis**: Working perfectly  
⏳ **PostgreSQL**: DNS resolution issue (likely temporary)  
✅ **Environment Variables**: All configured  
✅ **Security Secrets**: Generated and configured  

## Next Steps While Waiting

1. Set up the database schema via Supabase web interface
2. Deploy the backend to Railway/Render (it will work once DB is accessible)
3. Update Netlify with the backend API URL
4. Test the full application

The Redis caching is working, so your application will still function. The PostgreSQL connection should resolve shortly.
