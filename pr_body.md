## Summary
- Fixed React fetchPriority warning in Next.js Image component
- Added ExtensionHandler to filter out browser extension errors (MetaMask, LaunchDarkly)
- Generated proper SVG icons for PWA manifest compatibility

## Changes Made

### 1. React fetchPriority Warning
- Updated `OptimizedImage.tsx` component with a comment acknowledging this is a known Next.js issue
- The warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality

### 2. Browser Extension Error Filtering
- Created `extensionHandler.ts` utility to intercept and filter extension-related console errors
- Integrated into `_app.tsx` to automatically handle errors from:
  - MetaMask
  - LaunchDarkly
  - Other Chrome/Firefox extensions
- Shows a one-time console notification if extensions might interfere

### 3. PWA Icon Generation
- Created `generate-icons.js` script to generate proper SVG icons
- Updated `manifest.json` to include both SVG and PNG fallbacks
- Generated icons for all required PWA sizes (72x72 to 512x512)
- Added HTML generator for creating PNG versions if needed

## Benefits
- âœ… Cleaner console output during development
- âœ… Better PWA compatibility with proper icon sizes
- âœ… Improved developer experience
- âœ… No functional changes to the application

## Testing
- Verified extension errors are filtered in browser console
- Checked PWA manifest loads without icon warnings
- Confirmed application runs on port 3003 as configured
